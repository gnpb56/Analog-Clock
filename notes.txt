Calculation for Analogue clock:

1] For Hour Hand: 
12 Hours -> 360 degrees
1 Hours -> 30 degrees

60 minutes -> 30 degrees
1 minutes -> 1/2 degress

m minutes -> m/2 degrees

so the formula becomes: m Hourses n minutes -> (30m + n/2) degress


2] For Minute Hand: 

60 minutes -> 360 degrees
1 minutes -> 6 degrees

so the formula becomes: m minutes -> 6m degrees

2] For second Hand: 

60 seconds -> 360 degrees
1 seconds -> 6 degrees

so the formula becomes: m seconds -> 6m degrees
